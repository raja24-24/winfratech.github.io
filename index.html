		- TRAINING PROGRAMME IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING -TPSE – A WINFRA INITIATIVE
		</h1>
		<pre>
			
			•	TPSE  is a form of experimental learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and 
				skills development in a professional setting. 

			•	Provides an opportunity to gain valuable experience and make connections in professional fields that they are considering for career paths.

			•	Exposure to latest design techniques and design standards (Indian & International)

			•	Technical lectures

			•	Hands on training 

			•	Constant support , timely feedback and continuous evaluation

			•	Confidence building in structural engineering theory and practical

			•	Better career opportunities
		
		India produces one of the highest number of structural engineers in the world, but their employability has been a concern at both national and international levels. 
		While there exists a gap between what is learned in the class and what is expected at work, bridging this ‘Skill Gap’ has been a challenge of its own. 
		TPSE aims to identify and fill this gap through innovatively designed training programs for both students and working professionals
